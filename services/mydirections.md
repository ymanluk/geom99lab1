2. Including one to four additional functioning unique parameters from the API earns 50-70%
3. Having 3 or more functioning unique/novel and well-thought out parameters from the API earns 70-90%. Explore the API documentation for parameters we have not used.
4. Tell the story of your route. Include more than 2 "stops", and/or including additional links to display PlaceIDs on Google Maps, or other innovative presentations earns 80%-100%.
